        <p>This is a recipe on how to prepare kelewele the Ghanaian student way.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Hot pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 cup of oil</li>
            <li>5 ripe plantains</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a sharp knife, cut a shallow line down the length of the plantain and peel back the skin.</li>
            <li>Chop the plantain into small cubes of about 1 inch size.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger into a large bowl then add in chopped garlic and chopped onions. Blend them together.</li>
            <li>Now in the bow add the blend, add cayenne pepper, anise seed, nutmeg and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Next add in your plantain cubes and toss to coat in the spice mix.</li>
            <li>Leave to rest for 30 minutes. In a deep skillet, add enough oil to slightly submerge the plantains to fry them well.</li>
            <li>Separate the plantain into batches so that each lot can fry without touching one another. This is crucial to achieving the right texture.</li>
            <li>Now for each batch, add into the skillet to brown, turning once during the process. It should take about 5 minutes per batch.</li>
            <li>Use a strainer ladle to remove the plantains from the pan and rest on a plate covered with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Lightly dab the plantains with paper towels to soak up any excess oil and serve immediately.</li>
           
        </ol>
